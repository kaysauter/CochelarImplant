# Cochlear implant
What is a cochlear implant?

It is an surgical inserted implant into the ear that can bring profoundly hard of hearing and deaf people a hearing back. With Cochlear Implants, you can't hear perfectly after a surgery with this, but for me, I can usually even do phone calls with it. For more details, please refer to the following videos:
